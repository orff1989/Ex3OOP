# Graph Drawer - python
In this project, we were tasked to recreate our work from the previous assignment (written in Java) to Python.

As you'll see, in this project, you can load graphs from json files, edit the graph and run some algorithms on the graph.

# UML Diagram

This is a uml of the project:

### GUI:
Running the plot_graph() in the GraphAlgo class.

### Download and Run
To get this project you need to clone it into a Pycharm project.

Next, to run it, you need to go to main.py file.

## DiGraph class - implements GraphInterface

This class implement GraphInterface abstract class that represents an interface of a graph.

Each DiGraph contain dictionary of his nodes, and each node contain his edges.\
In addition each DiGraph holds the number of edges in the graph and a mode counter (mc)\
that represent the number of changes (add node, add edge, remove node or remove edge) in the graph.


| **Main methods**      |    **Details**        |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `v_size()` | Returns the number of vertices in this graph |
| `e_size()` | Returns the number of edges in this graph |
| `get_mc()` | Returns the current version of this graph |
| `add_edge()` | Adds an edge to the graph |
| `add_node()` | Adds a node to the graph |
| `remove_node()` | Removes a node from the graph |
| `remove_edge()` | Removes an edge from the graph |



## GraphAlgo class - implenents GraphAlgoInterface
This class implement GraphAlgoInterface abstract class that represents an interface of a graph.\
Each GraphAlgo contain a DiGraph on which the algorithm works on.


| **Main methods**      |    **Details**        |
|-----------------|-----------------------|
| `get_graph()` | Rutern the directed graph on which the algorithm works on |
| `load_from_json()` | Loads a graph from a json file |
| `save_to_json()` | Saves the graph in JSON format to a file |
| `shortest_path()` | Returns the shortest path from node id1 to node id2 using Dijkstra's Algorithm |
| `plot_graph()` | Plots the graph |
